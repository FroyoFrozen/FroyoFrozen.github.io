      <h2> The Feedback from the Who am i? assignment</h2>
      <p>Welcome Dinand Willaert,</p>
      <p>It is nice to see that you already have a goal in mind and want to pursue game development.</p>
      <p>I noticed you mentioned you are looking for an opportunity in the future to use your creativity,
        why does that motivate you?<br>
        what in being creative helps you?</p>
      <p>Or what are the opportunities you believe you can use it in ICT besides in creating games?<br>
        Try and think of what will help you stay motivated during the 4 year program, what will keep
        you going when it becomes more challenging? </p>
      <p>Same goes for your vision for your future, what careers interest you?<br>
        I recommend you to explore more and read on different careers which can bring out your creativity.<br>
        There will be a company conference during your first year where you can also get to know and listen to
        companies,
        recommend you to pay attention there too.</p>
      <p>Regarding your SWOT analysis, very nice self reflection, some questions to consider,</p>
      <p>What happens when youre not driven? is that a threat? when does that happen?
        what can you do to help yourself in those moments? <br>
        When you notice that youre getting distracted what helps you get back on track?
        can others help you with these challenges? how do you see yourself working in a team? </p>
      <p>What you think youre great at and what you want to improve more?</p>

    <h2>My thoughts</h2>
    <p>Overall, I think the feedback was very helpful, as it gave me stuff to think about.</p>
    <p>Creativity motivates me because I really enjoy making things.<br>
      I have a rich imagination and I am the happiest when I can do something with it. </p>
    <p>An example of creativity within ICT is what I am working on right now. web design!!!<br>
      I would also include things like creating a web application or app development </p>
    <p>A career that fits with these things is something like a software developer.<br>
      I think for now this would also be the career that I would want to pursue.</p>
    <p>Now about my SWOT analysis.</p>
    <p>If I am not driven, it is very difficult for me to get to work, and this can indeed become a threat.<br>
      But in general I always start eventually and once I start I can work for hours.</p>
    <p>At this moment i don't really have a trick for when I get distracted.<br>
      This would be the thing I hope to improve on for this year.</p>
