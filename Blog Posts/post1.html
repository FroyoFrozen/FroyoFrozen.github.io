  <h1>Study Choice</h1>
  <article>
    <h2>Study Choice Motivation</h2>
    <p>I chose this study programme because i hope to develop the necesarry skills to be admitted to a game
      development school in Breda.</p>
    <p>Besides that, i like to think of creative concepts and create these in real life. </p>
    <p>So even if i dont get accepted to the school in Breda, as long as i can have a job
      where i can use my creativity, i would be happy.</p>
    <p>I also believe there are alot of creative oppurtunities within iCT, so that's why i tought
      this study programme would suit me.</p>

    <h2>After completing the study</h2>
    <p>At the moment i hope to enter a game development school at Breda after my graduation,
      Because i would love to help in creating games like God of war or Elden ring.</p>
    <p>I don't expect to learn a whole lot about game development in this study programme,
      but i do remember you briefly go over it in the first year of this programme. </p>
    <p>More importantly i hope to learn programming on a high level in general.</p>
    <p>Because if the whole game development thing doesn't work out, i would like to be someone who uses
      programming to find creative solutions or improvements to something.</p>
    <p>Maybe something like a software engineer, but i am not quite sure yet.</p>

    <h2>Study Choice Activities</h2>
    <p>I went to multiple Open days for different studies, And i also used a website called Qompas to help me.</p>
    <p>Besides that i attented a couple online webinars to make my choice.</p>
